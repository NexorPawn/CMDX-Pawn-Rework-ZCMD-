# CMDX-Pawn-Rework-ZCMD-
A new command processor is being created for pawn samp, based on zcmd

CMDX - This is a stable and extensible command processor for SA-MP, built on zcmd with an emphasis on simplicity, macros, and alias support.

> Creator: **Nexor**
> Version: **v1.0.1 Actual (2025)**  
> Based on ZCMD, rewritten and improved

**Features**

Alias support
Macro syntax: CMD:name(playerid, params[])
Flexible parameter parsing — no need for SSCANF
Easy to integrate
No extra dependencies


**Installation**

1. Download the include file.
2. Extract it into the pawno/includes/ folder.
3. Then, include it in your mode using:
#include <cmdx>

Note: Disable SSCANF, as this include/plugin provides similar functionality built-in — just under a different function name.

There are some small errors as this is a test version, I know about some errors and improvements, errors need to be fixed, I will definitely fix them and release a new update!)

Also write what can be corrected, improved, and added.
